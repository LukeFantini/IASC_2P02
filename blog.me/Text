"Quantative research provides a type of  which is ideally independent of interpretations" (Moretti, pg. 72). The idea of intepretation is a crucial idea when discussing how digital humanities is looking to be useful in an academic field. For something to be considered a place of potential study for students and employement an area needs to established for its practice and use. Digital humanities is on the verge of the technilogical field and has many advantages older fields in humanities does not have. Technology allows investment in new areas and discovery of trends and data that can benefit us far into the future as technology continues to become more entrenched in our everyday lives and values. Moretti argues that if digital humanities want to capture this idea it must be examining quantative data which can show us something. This idea is unpopular in digital humanities as other digital scholars like, Ramsay and Drucker argue that digital humanities needs to be looking at human inspires data like capta which is heavily interpretive and better represents the human experience and how we experience things. "The standard elements of graphic display for statistical information are simple and limited" (Drucker, para. 15). This approach is flawed because it does not have the answers to what digital humanities wants to do the most, that is answer important questions. The graph below shows discussion points of digital scholars and it will further prove why capta is an insuficcient way of moving digital humanities forward.

As you can see in the vizualization the word use in both Drucker and Morreti's writings are both very intersting and it shows us what words they use the most within thier writings. The words like data and information are larger and more used within the writings. It it clear that by talking about certain topics they find them to be more important than others and even Drucker who think capta can be just as usefull talk more about quantative information than capta itself. In reality digital humanities can be gateway to discovering new and conclusive data. Even if dissenting voices disagree, they still value data highly and this shows that it is still valuable. We need to realize the value of data over capta if we want to move forward in digital humanities and what if provides to the human experience. "Capta is “taken” actively while data is assumed to be a “given” able to be recorded and observed" (Drucker, para. 3). Drucker and Ramsay think that when using data it does not capture the complex and interesting ways that humans live their daily lives. If we fail to account for eveything that humans experience we do not capture the human expereince and as a result fail to progress it. The idea of each individual experiencing an event differently is true they fail to realize that for digital humanities to be useful it cannot utilize something that is not concrete.
" ...these sociologists had increasingly come to understand empirical social research as “above all, quantitative research" (Porsdam para. 36). We know humans always experience things in different ways but that capta will not result in anything useful. How someone waits at a train stop or how someone experiences a bus ride too school as personal and individually based. They cannot be used as data to find a solution to anything becasue that experience is based from person to person. If we take a quantative approach and look at time it takes for the bus to get to school or the trains downtime we can solidfy actual solutions which realize and fix the issues, which will result in people having better personal experiences during those times. Capta alone provides no solution it just looks at the human experience during a period of time. If digital humanities wants to scale up and be taken seriously as a field of study it has data and better tools then ever to reterieve that data from.
The flaw with digital humanists is that they want to be uniqe from other fields and use their fields of study to be able to better capture the human experience. What they fail to realize is that digital humanities is already more than qualified and valid to do that, and it can do it better than any other area of study. Learning about online tools and using data to answer problems we face in our everday lives, will become the most effective way of learning about ourselves and no one but the digital humanities will be able to answer that call. Moretti wants to fuse the humanities with actual data and it works, academics will look to digital humanities to solve problems they cannot. It will grow once people realize that a growing technological is required to discover new things. By trying to differentate ourselves as seeing capta as valid we lose our credibility to provide useful humanistic data to other fields of study. A field with little value will ultimatly fail. Digital Humanities has the ability to be something wholy unique and crucially important as we grow more technologically reliant but only by using concrete data to solve problems will we be able to provide a better human experience long into the future.
