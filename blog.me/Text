"Quantative research provides a type of  which is ideally independent of interpretations" (Moretti, pg. 72). The idea of intepretation is a crucial idea when discussing how digital humanities is looking to be useful in an academic field. For something to be considered a place of potential study for students and employement an area needs to established for its practice and use. Digital humanities is on the verge of the technilogical field and has many advantages older fields in humanities does not have. Technology allows investment in new areas and discovery of trends and data that can benefit us far into the future as technology continues to become more entrenched in our everyday lives and values. Moretti argues that if digital humanities want to capture this idea it must be examining quantative data which can show us something. This idea is unpopular in digital humanities as other digital scholars like, Ramsay and Drucker argue that digital humanities needs to be looking at human inspires data like capta which is heavily interpretive and better represents the human experience and how we experience things. "The standard elements of graphic display for statistical information are simple and limited" (Drucker, para. 15). This approach is flawed because it does not have the answers to what digital humanities wants to do the most, that is answer important questions. The graph below shows discussion points of digital scholars and it will further prove why capta is an insuficcient way of moving digital humanities forward.

As you can see in the vizualization the word use in both Drucker and Morreti's writings are both very intersting and it shows us what words they use the most within thier writings. The words like data and information are larger and more used within the writings. It it clear that by talking about certain topics they find them to be more important than others and even Drucker who think capta can be just as usefull talk more about quantative information than capta itself.
